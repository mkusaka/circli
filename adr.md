Okay, let's summarize the decisions made so far as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in English. I'll create separate ADRs for the major decisions.

---

**ADR-001: Use TypeScript with Strict Type Checking**

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** We are building a CLI tool for CircleCI, and we want to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reduce runtime errors.
*   **Decision:** We will use TypeScript as the primary programming language and enable strict type checking (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`).
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Improved code quality and maintainability.
    *   Early detection of potential errors through static type checking.
    *   Better developer experience with autocompletion and type hints.
    *   Requires more upfront effort to define types.

**ADR-002: Use `openapi-typescript` and `openapi-fetch`**

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** We need to interact with the CircleCI API, which is defined by an OpenAPI specification. We want to ensure type safety and minimize boilerplate code.
*   **Decision:** We will use `openapi-typescript` to generate TypeScript types from the CircleCI OpenAPI specification, and `openapi-fetch` to create a type-safe API client.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Strong type safety for API interactions.
    *   Reduced boilerplate code for API requests.
    *   Automatic updates to types when the OpenAPI specification changes (by regenerating types).
    *   Dependency on `openapi-typescript` and `openapi-fetch`.

**ADR-003: Use `neverthrow` for Error Handling**

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** We need a consistent and robust way to handle errors throughout the CLI application.
*   **Decision:** We will use the `neverthrow` library to represent results as `Result` types, which can be either `Ok` (success) or `Err` (failure).
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Explicit error handling in all parts of the application.
    *   Improved error propagation and handling.
    *   Avoids unexpected crashes due to unhandled exceptions.
    *   Requires a slight learning curve for developers unfamiliar with `Result` types.

**ADR-004: Use `@cliffy/command` for CLI Argument Parsing**

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** We need a library to handle command-line argument parsing, command structure, and help text generation.
*   **Decision:** We will use the `@cliffy/command` library.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Simplified command-line argument parsing.
    *   Automatic generation of help text and usage instructions.
    *   Well-defined structure for commands, subcommands, and options.
    *   Dependency on `@cliffy/command`.

---

**ADR-005: Use `vitest` for Testing**

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** We need a testing framework to write unit and integration tests for the CLI.
*   **Decision:** We will use `vitest` as the testing framework.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Fast and efficient testing.
    *   Good developer experience with features like watch mode and snapshot testing.
    *   Familiar syntax (similar to Jest).
    *   Dependency on `vitest`.

---

**ADR-006: Use `tsx` for Local Development and `tsc` for Building**

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:**  We need a way to run TypeScript code during development without a separate compilation step, and a way to build the CLI for distribution.
*   **Decision:**  We will use `tsx` for running TypeScript code directly during local development (using `node --import tsx`) and `tsc` (the TypeScript compiler) for building the distributable package.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Fast feedback loop during development with `tsx`.
    *   Standard TypeScript compilation with `tsc` for production builds.
    *   Dependencies on `tsx` (for development) and `typescript`.

---

**ADR-007:  Configuration File Format and Location**

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:**  The CLI needs to store configuration such as API tokens and default project settings.
* **Decision:** We will use a YAML file located at `~/.circleci/config.yml` to store the configuration.
* **Consequences:**
    *   A standard location for configuration.
    *   Human-readable and editable configuration file.
    *   Need to handle file I/O and YAML parsing.

---
**ADR-008:  Naming of API Client Creation Function**

* **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** The `openapi-fetch` library provides a `createClient` function, and we also have a function to create our CircleCI API client.  This creates a naming conflict.
*  **Decision:** We will rename our client creation function to `createCircleCIClient` to avoid the name collision with the imported `createClient` from `openapi-fetch`.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Clear and unambiguous naming.
    *   Avoids potential confusion and errors.

These ADRs document the key architectural decisions made during the initial design and implementation of the CircleCI CLI. They provide context and rationale for the choices made, which will be helpful for future development and maintenance.
